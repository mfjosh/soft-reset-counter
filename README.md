# soft-reset-counter
I am creating this script as a test of how much I can learn in Python. So far, I have made a working counter in console and in GUI. I am tweaking the GUI and functions constantly.

The idea is to eventually have an automatic reset counter based on screen input but that is far away.


I will also be looking into somehow connecting with stream deck for on the fly adding / subtracting, however since hotkeys are bound this is not neccessary currently.
